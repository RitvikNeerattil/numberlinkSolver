Please try to run the environment and get familiar with its public API. We'll use the vector environment (see https://misaghsoltani.github.io/NumberLink/usage.html#vector-environment and https://misaghsoltani.github.io/NumberLink/apidocs/numberlink/numberlink.vector_env.html) in DeepXube so we can  use multiple instances of the environment efficiently in parallel (e.g. for generating data we create 10k instances and take given number of random steps).

Use fully connected layers not convolutional because convolutional better for image.
One hot encoded rep of each state?
First gen data, use data encoder and parts will be trained, check documentation for deepxube, well mostly use similar/same config for numberlink as cube3 env, some dimensions config change, then heuristic training, hopefully learn a heuristic that will get good estimations
